* The functions in this file are for manipulating the WellData structure
*   in ProblemData and work in conjuction with the WellPackage module.
*
* Because of the times things are called, the New function is twinky
* (it was basically put in to be symmetric with the New/Free paradigm
* used through out the code) and is invoked by SetProblemData.  The Alloc
* function actually allocates the data within the sub-structures and is
* invoked by the WellPackage (which has the data needed to compute the array
* sizes and such).  The Free is smart enough to clean up after both the New
* and Alloc functions and is called by SetProblemData.
